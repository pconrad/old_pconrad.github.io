The range of the alto saxophone is from concert D♭3 (the D♭ below middle C—see [Scientific pitch notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_pitch_notation)) to concert A♭5 (or A5 on altos with a high F♯ key). As with most types of saxophones, the standard written range is B♭3 to F6 (or F♯6). Above that, the altissimo register begins at F♯6 (or G6) and extends upwards.
