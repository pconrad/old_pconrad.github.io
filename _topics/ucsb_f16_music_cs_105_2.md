# Instrument Ranges

## Alto Sax:

</div>

The range of the alto saxophone is from concert D♭3 (the D♭ below middle C—see [Scientific pitch notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_pitch_notation)) to concert A♭5 (or A5 on altos with a high F♯ key). As with most types of saxophones, the standard written range is B♭3 to F6 (or F♯6). Above that, the altissimo register begins at F♯6 (or G6) and extends upwards.


# Cello

The image here (from the Scotland Chamber Orchestra's website) is an "indication of the range of the cello, from its lowest note (C two octaves below middle C) to approx C an octave above middle C."

According to that site:

> It is possible to play even higher, for which the player would use ‘thumb position’. But if writing high cello passages in a chamber 
> music context, ask yourself whether high passages would be served just as well being played by [another instrument] 
> or if you’re deliberately using this extreme of the instrument’s range for effect.
