1.  When sending an initial email, or a reminder, be sure that each time the email has the basic information in it.

   * What kind of thing you are asking for a LoR for (grad school, study abroad, scholarship, etc.)
   * A link to a web page that describes the program (the degree program, the scholarship, etc.)
   * The deadline
   * How the letter is to be submitted
       * Sometimes the letter has to be emailed to a particular address
       * Sometimes the letter has to be uploaded to a webpage, and the faculty member gets an email with a link to upload it
       * Rarely these days, but sometimes it has to be a physical letter on letterhead actually sent through the mail.
   
    I want to emphasize: The following email is helpful, but insufficient.
    
    ```
    Dear Professor, 
       I wanted to remind you about the letter of reference you are writing for me.
       The deadline is Friday.
        
       Thanks again for agreeing to do this.
    Sincerely,
    Chris Gaucho
    ```
    
    That sends me on a hunt through dozens of emails from Chris Gaucho, a few of which mention the scholarship letter,
    and perhaps only ONE among dozens has the information needed.  In the time I'm searching for that, it's easy to get 
    distracted by other emails, other demands on my time, etc.
    
    What is more helpful is:
    
     ```
    Dear Professor, 
       I wanted to remind you about the letter of reference you are writing for me 
       for that scholarship.
       
       The deadline is this coming Friday and information about the program is
       linked to below.
        
       Thanks again for agreeing to do this.
    Sincerely,
    Chris Gaucho
    
    [LINK APPEARS HERE to a page with all the needed information]
    [OR... all the information needed has been copied/pasted into the email.]
    
    ```
    
    That way, when I see the email, I can focus in on getting this done---all the information I need is right in front of me.
    It becomes far easier to ensure that it gets done before the next interruption.
